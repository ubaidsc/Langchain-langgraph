## Code Structure

### Main Components

1. **GeminiChatbot Class**: Main chatbot implementation

   - `constructor()`: Initializes Gemini model, memory, and prompt template
   - `startChat()`: Begins the interactive chat session
   - `chatLoop()`: Handles user input and generates responses
   - `clearMemory()`: Resets conversation memory
   - `showMemoryStats()`: Displays current memory statistics

2. **Memory Management**: Uses LangChain's BufferMemory for context retention

3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for API issues and user input

### Configuration Options

You can customize the chatbot by modifying these parameters in the constructor:

```javascript
this.model = new ChatGoogleGenerativeAI({
  apiKey: process.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY,
  modelName: "gemini-1.5-pro", // Model version
  temperature: 0.7, // Response creativity (0-1)
  maxOutputTokens: 2048, // Maximum response length
});
```

## Troubleshooting

   - Verify the API key is valid and active

2. **Network Issues**:
